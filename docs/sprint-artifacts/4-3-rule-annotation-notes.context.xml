    <tasks>      <![CDATA[
      - [ ] Notes table + helper (AC: 1–3)  
  - [ ] Create `rule_notes` table similar to other tables; add helper functions to insert/update/delete.  
- [ ] UI integration (AC: 1–3)  
  - [ ] “Add Note” button in Rule Explorer + Drawer; use Streamlit form.  
  - [ ] Notes list with edit/delete buttons (respect RBAC).  
- [ ] Export integration (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] When exporting rule briefs, include notes section.  
- [ ] Messaging (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Add copy explaining purpose of notes in UI.

      1. From the Rule Explorer or Drawer (Story 4.2), selecting a rule and clicking “Add Note” opens a text input supporting Markdown; saving persists to DuckDB `rule_notes` table with columns `note_id`, `rule_id`, `author`, `timestamp`, `content`.
2. Existing notes display in the drawer under a “Notes” tab with author + timestamp; notes are sorted newest-first.
3. Notes can be edited/deleted by the same author (or admin). Actions are logged to `activity_log` (Epic 6).
4. Persona/report exports include relevant notes for the rules referenced in the story.
5. Empty-state messaging explains that annotations help track customer-specific tweaks.

  <constraints>      <![CDATA[
      - Align with FR24 (annotations).  
- Consider storing `author` from env/role selection (since no auth system yet).  
- Keep deletion soft (set `deleted_at`) for audit trail.

### Project Structure Notes

- Helpers likely belong in `backend/services/rules.py`.  
- UI forms should appear inside Drawer’s “Notes” section.
