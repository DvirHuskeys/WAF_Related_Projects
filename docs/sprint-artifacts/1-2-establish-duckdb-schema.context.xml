    <tasks>      <![CDATA[
      - [ ] Implement `scripts/init_duckdb.py` (AC: 1,4)  
  - [ ] Use `duckdb.connect("data/warehouse.db")` and execute the CREATE TABLE statements from PRD.  
  - [ ] Enable JSON extension (`INSTALL/LOAD json`) before creating tables.  
- [ ] Make migration idempotent (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Wrap CREATE statements with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` or check catalog before creation.  
  - [ ] Add sanity check query that prints table counts after creation.  
- [ ] Developer ergonomics (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Document the command in README/Makefile.  
  - [ ] Emit clear console output (success + next steps).

      1. Given I run `python scripts/init_duckdb.py` (or the equivalent storage helper), when `data/warehouse.db` does not exist, then tables `domain_enrichment` and `managed_rules` are created with the columns defined in the PRD (including JSON fields).
2. Re-running the script is idempotent: schema creation does not fail if the database or tables already exist.
3. The script prints success/failure messaging and exits non‑zero on fatal errors; docs/README reference the command.
4. JSON support is enabled in DuckDB so `raw` and `metadata` columns accept structured content.

      - Aligns with architecture goal of keeping everything local-first (`docs/architecture.md#1-project-context--goals`).  
- Schema definitions come straight from `docs/prd.md#functional-requirements` → Intelligence Harvesting & Rule Transparency sections.  
- Script should live under `scripts/` per project structure established in Story 1.1; reuse the same virtualenv instructions.  
- Future epics (radar, persona) depend on these tables, so include simple validation query (e.g., `duckdb.sql("DESCRIBE domain_enrichment")`) after creation.

### Project Structure Notes

- Place the script in `scripts/` and update the root README/Makefile created in Story 1.1 so the bootstrap sequence becomes: create venv → run `init_duckdb.py` → seed sample data.  
- Ensure `backend/services/storage.py` exposes helper functions that the CLI and Streamlit UI can reuse (avoid duplicate SQL). No path conflicts detected.
