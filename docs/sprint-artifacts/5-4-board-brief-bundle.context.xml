    <tasks>      <![CDATA[
      - [ ] Template + data aggregation (AC: 1–2)  
  - [ ] Build helper that ranks domains by drift/downtime, fetches persona hooks + rule notes, and renders Markdown.  
- [ ] UI/CLI integration (AC: 1,3,4)  
  - [ ] Add button in Streamlit + CLI path for automation.  
  - [ ] Provide preview + toast.  
- [ ] Documentation (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] README instructions for board brief generation and customization.

  <acceptanceCriteria>      <![CDATA[
      1. Clicking “Generate Board Brief” creates a Markdown/PDF file `docs/reports/board-brief-<timestamp>.md` containing: summary section, top 5 domains by drift/downtime, key persona hooks per domain, rule transparency highlights (including freshness), and recommended CTAs.
2. Brief explicitly quotes data sources (timestamps, rule IDs) and includes a log reference (job ID).
3. UI preview is available; success toast references file path.
4. CLI command `python scripts/export_board_brief.py` (or a flag in existing export CLI) produces the same output.
5. README describes usage and how to customize number of domains or data sections.

      - Reuses components from Stories 5.1–5.3; focus on aggregated narrative.  
- Consider parameterizing domain count or risk threshold via env/config.

### Project Structure Notes

- Template under `docs/templates/board_brief.md.j2`; render via export helper.
