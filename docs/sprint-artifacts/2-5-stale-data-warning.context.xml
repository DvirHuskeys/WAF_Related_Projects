    <tasks>      <![CDATA[
      - [ ] Freshness util (AC: 1–5)  
  - [ ] Add helper `is_stale(timestamp, threshold_days=30)` reused across UI/API/export paths.  
- [ ] Streamlit indicators (AC: 1 & 2)  
  - [ ] Radar table and persona cards display amber badge per UX spec.  
  - [ ] Rule Studio highlights stale rules (ties into Story 4.4).  
- [ ] API + exports (AC: 3 & 4)  
  - [ ] Persona endpoint returns `stale_warning` string (or null).  
  - [ ] Report templates append stale footnotes.  
- [ ] Config (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Document env var (`STALE_THRESHOLD_DAYS`) and default value.

  <acceptanceCriteria>      <![CDATA[
      1. Given a domain row whose `last_observed` is older than the freshness SLA (30 days), when the Streamlit UI renders the Radar table or persona cards, then a warning badge (“Data 37d old – re-run enrichment”) appears inline.
2. When a managed rule’s metadata timestamp exceeds the SLA, Rule Transparency views and exports show the same warning badge.
3. Persona API responses include a `stale_warning` field so downstream tools (exports, GTM snippets) can display the message.
4. Markdown/PDF exports append a footnote listing stale items.
5. SLA threshold is configurable via env or settings file; default remains 30 days.

  <constraints>      <![CDATA[
      - Reuses scoring/fingerprinting timestamps from earlier stories.  
- Keep warnings unobtrusive but visible (Midnight Intelligence amber palette).  
- Tests should cover boundary conditions (29 vs 30 days).

### Project Structure Notes

- Helper can live in `backend/services/freshness.py`; import wherever needed.  
- Ensure CLI docs mention how to override SLA.
