      - [ ] Data query (AC: 1 & 3)  
  - [ ] Reuse freshness helper to fetch stale domains/rules along with last job ID.  
- [ ] Admin UI (AC: 1–2,4)  
  - [ ] Render table under Admin tab; include copy buttons for CLI hints.  
  - [ ] Show last job status (from `job_runs`).  
- [ ] Documentation (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] README update describing stale alert workflow.

      1. Admin tab displays a table listing domains/rules whose freshness exceeds the SLA, showing type (domain/rule), identifier, last updated, and recommended command.
2. Each row includes “Copy command” buttons that output the exact CLI command (e.g., `python scripts/domain_enrich.py data/samples/domains.csv --limit 10`) tailored to that item.
3. Table refreshes when data changes or when the user clicks “Refresh list.”
4. Warnings integrate with job logging so the table can show whether a re-run recently happened.
5. README documents how to use the stale alert panel.

      - Built on top of Stories 2.5 and 4.4; primarily a UX/reporting layer.  
- Keep copy buttons role-restricted (admin only).

### Project Structure Notes

- Share components with adapter panel (same Admin tab).  
- Queries can live in `backend/services/freshness.py`.
