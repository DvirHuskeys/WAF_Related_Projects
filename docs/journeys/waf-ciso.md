# Journey: CISO Cassandra (WAFtotal)

## Trigger
- Needs transparent vendor comparison for upcoming renewal.
- Skeptical about marketing claims that lack rule-level evidence.

## Desired proof
- Know which attack categories each vendor prioritizes.
- See how quickly rules update after new CVEs.
- Understand portability of a favorite rule to other stacks.

## Flow
1. Land on WAFtotal Explorer splash.
2. Filter by attack category (“injection”).
3. Compare vendor cards (coverage %, severity mix, freshness).
4. Open “Rule Remix” to port Cloudflare SQLi rule to AWS WAF.
5. Export talking points for security leadership.

## Metrics
- Time-to-insight < 2 minutes.
- At least one “aha” delta per session (e.g., missing bot threshold).
